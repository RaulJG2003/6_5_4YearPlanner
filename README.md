# 6_5_4YearPlanner
**UMBC Four Year Planner Project - Interactive Courses Planner for Incoming and Current Students** to complete their program. This product will be an interactive website.

## Overview
UMBC needs an interactive 4-year course planning tool to replace the current static document, allowing students to customize their academic plan based on advisor recommendations, personal preferences, and AP credits.

### Key Features
* **Customizable Course Plan**: Modify the advising plan dynamically to reflect individual choices and prior credits.
* **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Users can easily move courses between semesters by dragging and dropping them, facilitating quick adjustments to their academic plans.
* **Course Availability Insights**: Notes from senior students on course demand to help secure seats in popular classes.
* **Semester Offering Predictions**: Estimate the likelihood of a course being available in summer or winter based on past catalogs.
* **Credit Load Guidance**: Recommendations on optimal credit hours per semester.
* **Prerequisite Tracking**: Ensure students follow the correct course sequence, aligning with prerequisite requirements.

The tool will enhance academic planning without professor recommendations, leaving that choice to student research.
